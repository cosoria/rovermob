<h3>Mobile apps that work offline as well as online</h3>

<p>Occasionally-connected mobile apps cache the data that a user needs. This makes the apps
more responsive because they don't have to wait for the server.
It also means that the user can get to their data even if they don't have a signal.
And when they make changes, the app caches their work and sends it to the
distributor.</p>

<p>Other toolkits try to sync up relational models between client and server. But
Rover Mobile is message-based. Application state is stored as a history of partially
ordered facts. Facts are exchanged via message. And messages can be sent and received
in any order. Conflicts are detected, and can be presented to the user for resolution.</p>
